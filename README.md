## README
### Abstract
This is a scheduling software that makes printable schedules for students and teachers written using C# and the Blazor framework.

### Notes
This project was created and written in the last two semesters of my schooling at Saskatchewan Polytechnic in the CST program.
A team of 7 contributed to this project with a big focus on documentation in the form of UML, Sequence, and ER diagrams while following the AGILE approach.
This class mainly focused on the process rather than a completed project so unfortunately this project is not 100% finished.
